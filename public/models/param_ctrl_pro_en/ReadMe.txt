    Sample Model
    Sample for Parameter Controller

============================================================

    This is a sample using a "Parameter Controller" that increases animation production efficiency.
    A "Parameter Controller" has been added to the animation data.
    By using the Parameter Controller's target tracking, you can efficiently create animations that were previously difficult to create, such as holding something or touching the ground.
    You can also bake the following movement and reflect it in the motion data for embedding.
